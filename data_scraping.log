\u02c8\u025btik\u025bt k\u026at can be defined as a set of norms of personal behavior in polite society usually occurring in the form of an ethical code of the expected and accepted social behaviors that accord with the conventions and norms observed and practiced by a society a social class or a social group in modern english usage the french word étiquette label and tag dates from the year 1750 and also originates from the french word for ticket possibly symbolizing a person s entry into society through proper behavior there are many important historical figures that have helped to shape the meaning of the term as well as provide varying perspectives history in the third millennium bce the ancient egyptian vizier ptahhotep wrote the maxims of ptahhotep 2375 2350 bce a didactic book of precepts extolling civil virtues such as truthfulness self control and kindness towards other people recurrent thematic motifs in the maxims include learning by listening to other people being mindful of the imperfection of human knowledge that avoiding open conflict whenever possible should not be considered weakness and that the pursuit of justice should be foremost yet in human affairs the command of a god ultimately prevails in all matters some of ptahhotep s maxims indicate a person s correct behaviours in the presence of great personages political military religious and instructions on how to choose the right master and how to serve him other maxims teach the correct way to be a leader through openness and kindness that greed is the base of all evil and should be guarded against and that generosity towards family and friends is praiseworthy confucius 551 479 bce was a chinese intellectual and philosopher whose works emphasized personal and governmental morality correctness of social relationships the pursuit of justice in personal dealings and sincerity in all personal relations baldassare castiglione 1478 1529 ce count of casatico was an italian courtier and diplomat soldier and author of the book of the courtier 1528 an exemplar courtesy book dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier during the italian renaissance louis xiv 1638 1715 king of france used a codified etiquette to tame the french nobility and assert his supremacy as the absolute monarch of france in consequence the ceremonious royal court favourably impressed foreign dignitaries whom the king received at the seat of french government the palace of versailles to the south west of paris benjamin franklin 1706 1790 an american inventor and founding father contributed to the american understanding of etiquette through his emphasis on practical morality and social harmony in his autobiography published in 1791 franklin outlined a personal system of self improvement centered around thirteen virtues including sincerity humility and temperance he viewed etiquette as a means of fostering effective communication avoiding unnecessary conflict and promoting cooperation in both personal and public life franklin distrusted ostentatious formality and believed manners should serve a purpose rooted in usefulness sincerity and democratic ideals george washington 1732 1799 the first president of the united states and commander of the continental army during the american revolutionary war was heavily influenced in his youth by a set of social maxims titled rules of civility decent behaviour in company and conversation adapted from an earlier french text these 110 rules emphasized humility respect for others restraint and the importance of maintaining decorum in public life though washington did not write the rules himself copying them by hand served as early moral training and significantly shaped his public persona the maxims promoted the idea that civil behavior was a reflection of personal virtue and that etiquette could serve as a tool for cultivating leadership and moral character despite george washington s strong public support for education many of his contemporaries criticized his intellect labeling him as poorly educated and lacking eloquence figures like aaron burr thomas jefferson and john adams described him as unrefined grammatically weak and intellectually limited due to washington s personal sensitivity to the level of his academic exposure these critiques only increased the motivation to copy the 110 rules although there may not be any evidence of george washington verbally passing on the maxims his actions and character served as a physical example of these beliefs politeness in the 18th century during the age of enlightenment the adoption of etiquette was a self conscious process for acquiring the conventions of politeness and the normative behaviours charm manners demeanour which symbolically identified the person as a genteel member of the upper class to identify with the social élite the upwardly mobile middle class and the bourgeoisie adopted the behaviours and the artistic preferences of the upper class to that end socially ambitious people of the middle classes occupied themselves with learning knowing and practising the rules of social etiquette such as the arts of elegant dress and gracious conversation when to show emotion and courtesy with and towards women in the early 18th century anthony ashley cooper 3rd earl of shaftesbury wrote influential essays that defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company and discussed the function and nature of politeness in the social discourse of a commercial society politeness may be defined as dext rous management of our words and actions whereby we make other people have better opinion of us and themselves periodicals such as the spectator a daily publication founded in 1711 by joseph addison and richard steele regularly advised their readers on the etiquette required of a gentleman a man of good and courteous conduct their stated editorial goal was to enliven morality with wit and to temper wit with morality to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries schools and colleges to dwell in clubs and assemblies at tea tables and coffeehouses to which end the editors published articles written by educated authors which provided topics for civil conversation and advice on the requisite manners for carrying a polite conversation and for managing social interactions conceptually allied to etiquette is the notion of civility social interaction characterised by sober and reasoned debate which for socially ambitious men and women also became an important personal quality to possess for social advancement in the event gentlemen s clubs such as harrington s rota club published an in house etiquette that codified the civility expected of the members besides the spectator other periodicals sought to infuse politeness into english coffeehouse conversation the editors of the tatler were explicit that their purpose was the reformation of english manners and morals to those ends etiquette was presented as the virtue of morality and a code of behaviour in the mid 18th century the first modern english usage of etiquette the conventional rules of personal behaviour in polite society was by philip stanhope 4th earl of chesterfield in the book letters to his son on the art of becoming a man of the world and a gentleman 1774 a correspondence of more than 400 letters written from 1737 until the death of his son in 1768 most of the letters were instructive concerning varied subjects that a worldly gentleman should know the letters were first published in 1774 by eugenia stanhope the widow of the diplomat philip stanhope chesterfield s bastard son throughout the correspondence chesterfield endeavoured to decouple the matter of social manners from conventional morality with perceptive observations that pragmatically argue to philip that mastery of etiquette was an important means for social advancement for a man such as he chesterfield s elegant literary style of writing epitomised the emotional restraint characteristic of polite social intercourse in 18th century society i would heartily wish that you may often be seen to smile but never heard to laugh while you live frequent and loud laughter is the characteristic of folly and ill manners it is the manner in which the mob express their silly joy at silly things and they call it being merry in my mind there is nothing so illiberal and so ill bred as audible laughter i am neither of a melancholy nor a cynical disposition and am as willing and as apt to be pleased as anybody but i am sure that since i have had the full use of my reason nobody has ever heard me laugh in the 19th century victorian era 1837 1901 etiquette developed into a complicated system of codified behaviours which governed the range of manners in society from the proper language style and method for writing letters to correctly using cutlery at table and to the minute regulation of social relations and personal interactions between men and women and among the social classes in the 21st century specifically in the early 2020s as digital communication became more readily available and used in everyday life the notion of digital etiquette or netiquette evolved into a flexible socially negotiated code of conduct guiding behavior in online spaces unlike traditional etiquette which often revolved around visible symbols of status and formal conduct digital etiquette today is platform dependent highly situational and subtly influenced by unspoken social norms for instance a video call may press for visible presence camera on and active engagement such as contributing ideas or giving visual cues of attention while sending an email might demand carefully crafted language formal greetings and rapid response times to signal competence and respect an essential aspect of today s netiquette is the management of presence and attention the expectation to be responsive has become a symbol of respect while behaviors such as multitasking during meetings or disabling cameras may be interpreted as disrespect or disengagement manners sociological perspectives in a society manners are described as either good manners or as bad manners to indicate whether a person s behaviour is acceptable to the cultural group as such manners enable ultrasociality and are integral to the functioning of the social norms and conventions that are informally enforced through self regulation the perspectives of sociology indicate that manners are a means for people to display their social status and a means of demarcating observing and maintaining the boundaries of social identity and of social class in the civilizing process 1939 sociologist norbert elias said that manners arose as a product of group living and persist as a way of maintaining social order manners proliferated during the renaissance in response to the development of the absolute state the progression from small group living to large group living characterised by the centralized power of the state the rituals and manners associated with the royal court of england during that period were closely bound to a person s social status manners demonstrate a person s position within a social network and a person s manners are a means of negotiation from that social position from the perspective of public health in the healthy citizen 1995 alana r petersen and deborah lupton said that manners assisted the diminishment of the social boundaries that existed between the public sphere and the private sphere of a person s life and so gave rise to a highly reflective self a self who monitors his or her behavior with due regard for others with whom he or she interacts socially and that the public behavior of individuals came to signify their social standing a means of presenting the self and of evaluating others and thus the control of the outward self was vital sociologist pierre bourdieu applied the concept of habitus to define the societal functions of manners the habitus is the set of mental attitudes personal habits and skills that a person possesses his or her dispositions of character that are neither self determined nor pre determined by the external environment but which are produced and reproduced by social interactions and are inculcated through experience and explicit teaching yet tend to function at the subconscious level manners are likely to be a central part of the dispositions that guide a person s ability to decide upon socially compliant behaviours anthropologic perspective in purity and danger an analysis of concepts of pollution and taboo 2003 the anthropologist mary douglas said that manners social behaviors and group rituals enable the local cosmology to remain ordered and free from those things that may pollute or defile the integrity of the culture ideas of pollution defilement and disgust are attached to the margins of socially acceptable behaviour in order to curtail unacceptable behaviour and so maintain the assumptions by which experience is controlled within the culture evolutionary perspectives in studying the expression of emotion by humans and animals naturalist charles darwin noted the universality of facial expressions of disgust and shame among infants and blind people and concluded that the emotional responses of shame and disgust are innate behaviours public health specialist valerie curtis said that the development of facial responses was concomitant with the development of manners which are behaviours with an evolutionary role in preventing the transmission of diseases thus people who practise personal hygiene and politeness will most benefit from membership in their social group and so stand the best chance of biological survival by way of opportunities for reproduction from the study of the evolutionary bases of prejudice social psychologists catherine cottrell and steven neuberg said that human behavioural responses to otherness might enable the preservation of manners and social norms the feeling of foreignness which people experience in their first social interaction with someone from another culture might partly serve an evolutionary function group living surrounds one with individuals who are able to physically harm fellow group members to spread contagious disease or to free ride on their efforts therefore a commitment to sociality is a risk if threats such as these are left unchecked the costs of sociality will quickly exceed its benefits thus to maximize the returns on group living individual group members should be attuned to others features or behaviors therefore people who possess the social traits common to the cultural group are to be trusted and people without the common social traits are to be distrusted as others and thus treated with suspicion or excluded from the group that pressure of social exclusivity born from the shift towards communal living excluded uncooperative people and persons with poor personal hygiene the threat of social exclusion led people to avoid personal behaviours that might embarrass the group or that might provoke revulsion among the group to demonstrate the transmission of social conformity anthropologists joseph henrich and robert boyd developed a behavioural model in which manners are a means of mitigating social differences curbing undesirable personal behaviours and fostering co operation within the social group natural selection favoured the acquisition of genetically transmitted mechanisms for learning thereby increasing a person s chances for acquiring locally adaptive behaviours humans possess a reliably developing neural encoding that compels them both to punish individuals who violate group norms common beliefs or practices and to punish individuals who do not punish norm violators categories social manners are in three categories i manners of hygiene ii manners of courtesy and iii manners of cultural norm each category accounts for an aspect of the functional role that manners play in a society the categories of manners are based upon the social outcome of behaviour rather than upon the personal motivation of the behaviour as a means of social management the rules of etiquette encompass most aspects of human social interaction thus a rule of etiquette reflects an underlying ethical code and a person s fashion and social status manners of hygiene concern avoiding the transmission of disease and usually are taught by the parent to the child by way of parental discipline positive behavioural enforcement of body fluid continence toilet training and the avoidance of and removal of disease vectors that risk the health of children society expects that by adulthood the manners for personal hygiene have become a second nature behaviour violations of which shall provoke physical and moral disgust hygiene etiquette during the covid 19 pandemic included social distancing and warnings against public spitting manners of courtesy concern self control and good faith behaviour by which a person gives priority to the interests of another person and priority to the interests of a socio cultural group in order to be a trusted member of that group courtesy manners maximize the benefits of group living by regulating the nature of social interactions however the performance of courtesy manners occasionally interferes with the avoidance of communicable disease generally parents teach courtesy manners in the same way they teach hygiene manners but the child also learns manners directly by observing the behaviour of other people in their social interactions and by imagined social interactions through the executive functions of the brain a child usually learns courtesy manners at an older age than when he or she was toilet trained taught hygiene manners because learning the manners of courtesy requires that the child be self aware and conscious of social position which then facilitate understanding that violations accidental or deliberate of social courtesy will provoke peer disapproval within the social group manners of cultural norms concern the social rules by which a person establishes his or her identity and membership in a given socio cultural group in abiding the manners of cultural norm a person demarcates socio cultural identity and establishes social boundaries which then identify whom to trust and whom to distrust as the other cultural norm manners are learnt through the enculturation with and the routinisation of the familiar and through social exposure to the cultural otherness of people identified as foreign to the group transgressions and flouting of the manners of cultural norm usually result in the social alienation of the transgressor the nature of culture norm manners allows a high level of intra group variability but the manners usually are common to the people who identify with the given socio cultural group courtesy books 16th century the book of the courtier 1528 by baldassare castiglione identified the manners and the morals required by socially ambitious men and women for success in a royal court of the italian renaissance 14th 17th c as an etiquette text the courtier was an influential courtesy book in 16th century europe on civility in children 1530 by erasmus of rotterdam instructs boys in the means of becoming a young man how to walk and talk speak and act in the company of adults the practical advice for acquiring adult self awareness includes explanations of the symbolic meanings for adults of a boy s body language when he is fidgeting and yawning scratching and bickering on completing erasmus s curriculum of etiquette the boy has learnt that civility is the point of good manners the adult ability to readily ignore the faults of others but avoid falling short yourself in being civilised 20th century etiquette in society in business in politics and at home 1922 by emily post documents the trivialities of desirable conduct in daily life and provided pragmatic approaches to the practice of good manners the social conduct expected and appropriate for the events of life such as a baptism a wedding and a funeral as didactic texts books of etiquette the conventional rules of personal behaviour in polite society usually feature explanatory titles such as the ladies book of etiquette and manual of politeness a complete hand book for the use of the lady in polite society 1860 by florence hartley amy vanderbilt s complete book of etiquette 1957 miss manners guide to excruciatingly correct behavior 1979 by judith martin and peas queues the minefield of modern manners 2013 by sandi toksvig such books present ranges of civility socially acceptable behaviours for their respective times each author cautions the reader that to be a well mannered person they must practise good manners in their public and private lives the how rude comic book series addresses and discusses adolescent perspectives and questions of etiquette social manners and civility business in commerce the purpose of etiquette is to facilitate the social relations necessary for realising business transactions in particular social interactions among workers and between labour and management business etiquette varies by culture such as the chinese and australian approaches to conflict resolution the chinese business philosophy is based upon guanxi personal connections whereby person to person negotiation resolves difficult matters whereas australian business philosophy relies upon attorneys at law to resolve business conflicts through legal mediation thus adjusting to the etiquette and professional ethics of another culture is an element of culture shock for businesspeople in 2011 etiquette trainers formed the institute of image training and testing international iitti a non profit organisation to train personnel departments in measuring and developing and teaching social skills to employees by way of education in the rules of personal and business etiquette in order to produce business workers who possess standardised manners for successfully conducting business with people from other cultures in the retail branch of commerce the saying the customer is always right summarises the profit orientation of good manners between the buyer and the seller of goods and services there are always two sides to the case of course and it is a credit to good manners that there is scarcely ever any friction in stores and shops of the first class salesmen and women are usually persons who are both patient and polite and their customers are most often ladies in fact as well as by courtesy between those before and those behind the counters there has sprung up in many instances a relationship of mutual goodwill and friendliness it is in fact only the woman who is afraid that someone may encroach upon her exceedingly insecure dignity who shows

\u02c8\u025btik\u025bt k\u026at can be defined as a set of norms of personal behavior in polite society usually occurring in the form of an ethical code of the expected and accepted social behaviors that accord with the conventions and norms observed and practiced by a society a social class or a social group in modern english usage the french word étiquette label and tag dates from the year 1750 and also originates from the french word for ticket possibly symbolizing a person s entry into society through proper behavior there are many important historical figures that have helped to shape the meaning of the term as well as provide varying perspectives history in the third millennium bce the ancient egyptian vizier ptahhotep wrote the maxims of ptahhotep 2375 2350 bce a didactic book of precepts extolling civil virtues such as truthfulness self control and kindness towards other people recurrent thematic motifs in the maxims include learning by listening to other people being mindful of the imperfection of human knowledge that avoiding open conflict whenever possible should not be considered weakness and that the pursuit of justice should be foremost yet in human affairs the command of a god ultimately prevails in all matters some of ptahhotep s maxims indicate a person s correct behaviours in the presence of great personages political military religious and instructions on how to choose the right master and how to serve him other maxims teach the correct way to be a leader through openness and kindness that greed is the base of all evil and should be guarded against and that generosity towards family and friends is praiseworthy confucius 551 479 bce was a chinese intellectual and philosopher whose works emphasized personal and governmental morality correctness of social relationships the pursuit of justice in personal dealings and sincerity in all personal relations baldassare castiglione 1478 1529 ce count of casatico was an italian courtier and diplomat soldier and author of the book of the courtier 1528 an exemplar courtesy book dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier during the italian renaissance louis xiv 1638 1715 king of france used a codified etiquette to tame the french nobility and assert his supremacy as the absolute monarch of france in consequence the ceremonious royal court favourably impressed foreign dignitaries whom the king received at the seat of french government the palace of versailles to the south west of paris benjamin franklin 1706 1790 an american inventor and founding father contributed to the american understanding of etiquette through his emphasis on practical morality and social harmony in his autobiography published in 1791 franklin outlined a personal system of self improvement centered around thirteen virtues including sincerity humility and temperance he viewed etiquette as a means of fostering effective communication avoiding unnecessary conflict and promoting cooperation in both personal and public life franklin distrusted ostentatious formality and believed manners should serve a purpose rooted in usefulness sincerity and democratic ideals george washington 1732 1799 the first president of the united states and commander of the continental army during the american revolutionary war was heavily influenced in his youth by a set of social maxims titled rules of civility decent behaviour in company and conversation adapted from an earlier french text these 110 rules emphasized humility respect for others restraint and the importance of maintaining decorum in public life though washington did not write the rules himself copying them by hand served as early moral training and significantly shaped his public persona the maxims promoted the idea that civil behavior was a reflection of personal virtue and that etiquette could serve as a tool for cultivating leadership and moral character despite george washington s strong public support for education many of his contemporaries criticized his intellect labeling him as poorly educated and lacking eloquence figures like aaron burr thomas jefferson and john adams described him as unrefined grammatically weak and intellectually limited due to washington s personal sensitivity to the level of his academic exposure these critiques only increased the motivation to copy the 110 rules although there may not be any evidence of george washington verbally passing on the maxims his actions and character served as a physical example of these beliefs politeness in the 18th century during the age of enlightenment the adoption of etiquette was a self conscious process for acquiring the conventions of politeness and the normative behaviours charm manners demeanour which symbolically identified the person as a genteel member of the upper class to identify with the social élite the upwardly mobile middle class and the bourgeoisie adopted the behaviours and the artistic preferences of the upper class to that end socially ambitious people of the middle classes occupied themselves with learning knowing and practising the rules of social etiquette such as the arts of elegant dress and gracious conversation when to show emotion and courtesy with and towards women in the early 18th century anthony ashley cooper 3rd earl of shaftesbury wrote influential essays that defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company and discussed the function and nature of politeness in the social discourse of a commercial society politeness may be defined as dext rous management of our words and actions whereby we make other people have better opinion of us and themselves periodicals such as the spectator a daily publication founded in 1711 by joseph addison and richard steele regularly advised their readers on the etiquette required of a gentleman a man of good and courteous conduct their stated editorial goal was to enliven morality with wit and to temper wit with morality to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries schools and colleges to dwell in clubs and assemblies at tea tables and coffeehouses to which end the editors published articles written by educated authors which provided topics for civil conversation and advice on the requisite manners for carrying a polite conversation and for managing social interactions conceptually allied to etiquette is the notion of civility social interaction characterised by sober and reasoned debate which for socially ambitious men and women also became an important personal quality to possess for social advancement in the event gentlemen s clubs such as harrington s rota club published an in house etiquette that codified the civility expected of the members besides the spectator other periodicals sought to infuse politeness into english coffeehouse conversation the editors of the tatler were explicit that their purpose was the reformation of english manners and morals to those ends etiquette was presented as the virtue of morality and a code of behaviour in the mid 18th century the first modern english usage of etiquette the conventional rules of personal behaviour in polite society was by philip stanhope 4th earl of chesterfield in the book letters to his son on the art of becoming a man of the world and a gentleman 1774 a correspondence of more than 400 letters written from 1737 until the death of his son in 1768 most of the letters were instructive concerning varied subjects that a worldly gentleman should know the letters were first published in 1774 by eugenia stanhope the widow of the diplomat philip stanhope chesterfield s bastard son throughout the correspondence chesterfield endeavoured to decouple the matter of social manners from conventional morality with perceptive observations that pragmatically argue to philip that mastery of etiquette was an important means for social advancement for a man such as he chesterfield s elegant literary style of writing epitomised the emotional restraint characteristic of polite social intercourse in 18th century society i would heartily wish that you may often be seen to smile but never heard to laugh while you live frequent and loud laughter is the characteristic of folly and ill manners it is the manner in which the mob express their silly joy at silly things and they call it being merry in my mind there is nothing so illiberal and so ill bred as audible laughter i am neither of a melancholy nor a cynical disposition and am as willing and as apt to be pleased as anybody but i am sure that since i have had the full use of my reason nobody has ever heard me laugh in the 19th century victorian era 1837 1901 etiquette developed into a complicated system of codified behaviours which governed the range of manners in society from the proper language style and method for writing letters to correctly using cutlery at table and to the minute regulation of social relations and personal interactions between men and women and among the social classes in the 21st century specifically in the early 2020s as digital communication became more readily available and used in everyday life the notion of digital etiquette or netiquette evolved into a flexible socially negotiated code of conduct guiding behavior in online spaces unlike traditional etiquette which often revolved around visible symbols of status and formal conduct digital etiquette today is platform dependent highly situational and subtly influenced by unspoken social norms for instance a video call may press for visible presence camera on and active engagement such as contributing ideas or giving visual cues of attention while sending an email might demand carefully crafted language formal greetings and rapid response times to signal competence and respect an essential aspect of today s netiquette is the management of presence and attention the expectation to be responsive has become a symbol of respect while behaviors such as multitasking during meetings or disabling cameras may be interpreted as disrespect or disengagement manners sociological perspectives in a society manners are described as either good manners or as bad manners to indicate whether a person s behaviour is acceptable to the cultural group as such manners enable ultrasociality and are integral to the functioning of the social norms and conventions that are informally enforced through self regulation the perspectives of sociology indicate that manners are a means for people to display their social status and a means of demarcating observing and maintaining the boundaries of social identity and of social class in the civilizing process 1939 sociologist norbert elias said that manners arose as a product of group living and persist as a way of maintaining social order manners proliferated during the renaissance in response to the development of the absolute state the progression from small group living to large group living characterised by the centralized power of the state the rituals and manners associated with the royal court of england during that period were closely bound to a person s social status manners demonstrate a person s position within a social network and a person s manners are a means of negotiation from that social position from the perspective of public health in the healthy citizen 1995 alana r petersen and deborah lupton said that manners assisted the diminishment of the social boundaries that existed between the public sphere and the private sphere of a person s life and so gave rise to a highly reflective self a self who monitors his or her behavior with due regard for others with whom he or she interacts socially and that the public behavior of individuals came to signify their social standing a means of presenting the self and of evaluating others and thus the control of the outward self was vital sociologist pierre bourdieu applied the concept of habitus to define the societal functions of manners the habitus is the set of mental attitudes personal habits and skills that a person possesses his or her dispositions of character that are neither self determined nor pre determined by the external environment but which are produced and reproduced by social interactions and are inculcated through experience and explicit teaching yet tend to function at the subconscious level manners are likely to be a central part of the dispositions that guide a person s ability to decide upon socially compliant behaviours anthropologic perspective in purity and danger an analysis of concepts of pollution and taboo 2003 the anthropologist mary douglas said that manners social behaviors and group rituals enable the local cosmology to remain ordered and free from those things that may pollute or defile the integrity of the culture ideas of pollution defilement and disgust are attached to the margins of socially acceptable behaviour in order to curtail unacceptable behaviour and so maintain the assumptions by which experience is controlled within the culture evolutionary perspectives in studying the expression of emotion by humans and animals naturalist charles darwin noted the universality of facial expressions of disgust and shame among infants and blind people and concluded that the emotional responses of shame and disgust are innate behaviours public health specialist valerie curtis said that the development of facial responses was concomitant with the development of manners which are behaviours with an evolutionary role in preventing the transmission of diseases thus people who practise personal hygiene and politeness will most benefit from membership in their social group and so stand the best chance of biological survival by way of opportunities for reproduction from the study of the evolutionary bases of prejudice social psychologists catherine cottrell and steven neuberg said that human behavioural responses to otherness might enable the preservation of manners and social norms the feeling of foreignness which people experience in their first social interaction with someone from another culture might partly serve an evolutionary function group living surrounds one with individuals who are able to physically harm fellow group members to spread contagious disease or to free ride on their efforts therefore a commitment to sociality is a risk if threats such as these are left unchecked the costs of sociality will quickly exceed its benefits thus to maximize the returns on group living individual group members should be attuned to others features or behaviors therefore people who possess the social traits common to the cultural group are to be trusted and people without the common social traits are to be distrusted as others and thus treated with suspicion or excluded from the group that pressure of social exclusivity born from the shift towards communal living excluded uncooperative people and persons with poor personal hygiene the threat of social exclusion led people to avoid personal behaviours that might embarrass the group or that might provoke revulsion among the group to demonstrate the transmission of social conformity anthropologists joseph henrich and robert boyd developed a behavioural model in which manners are a means of mitigating social differences curbing undesirable personal behaviours and fostering co operation within the social group natural selection favoured the acquisition of genetically transmitted mechanisms for learning thereby increasing a person s chances for acquiring locally adaptive behaviours humans possess a reliably developing neural encoding that compels them both to punish individuals who violate group norms common beliefs or practices and to punish individuals who do not punish norm violators categories social manners are in three categories i manners of hygiene ii manners of courtesy and iii manners of cultural norm each category accounts for an aspect of the functional role that manners play in a society the categories of manners are based upon the social outcome of behaviour rather than upon the personal motivation of the behaviour as a means of social management the rules of etiquette encompass most aspects of human social interaction thus a rule of etiquette reflects an underlying ethical code and a person s fashion and social status manners of hygiene concern avoiding the transmission of disease and usually are taught by the parent to the child by way of parental discipline positive behavioural enforcement of body fluid continence toilet training and the avoidance of and removal of disease vectors that risk the health of children society expects that by adulthood the manners for personal hygiene have become a second nature behaviour violations of which shall provoke physical and moral disgust hygiene etiquette during the covid 19 pandemic included social distancing and warnings against public spitting manners of courtesy concern self control and good faith behaviour by which a person gives priority to the interests of another person and priority to the interests of a socio cultural group in order to be a trusted member of that group courtesy manners maximize the benefits of group living by regulating the nature of social interactions however the performance of courtesy manners occasionally interferes with the avoidance of communicable disease generally parents teach courtesy manners in the same way they teach hygiene manners but the child also learns manners directly by observing the behaviour of other people in their social interactions and by imagined social interactions through the executive functions of the brain a child usually learns courtesy manners at an older age than when he or she was toilet trained taught hygiene manners because learning the manners of courtesy requires that the child be self aware and conscious of social position which then facilitate understanding that violations accidental or deliberate of social courtesy will provoke peer disapproval within the social group manners of cultural norms concern the social rules by which a person establishes his or her identity and membership in a given socio cultural group in abiding the manners of cultural norm a person demarcates socio cultural identity and establishes social boundaries which then identify whom to trust and whom to distrust as the other cultural norm manners are learnt through the enculturation with and the routinisation of the familiar and through social exposure to the cultural otherness of people identified as foreign to the group transgressions and flouting of the manners of cultural norm usually result in the social alienation of the transgressor the nature of culture norm manners allows a high level of intra group variability but the manners usually are common to the people who identify with the given socio cultural group courtesy books 16th century the book of the courtier 1528 by baldassare castiglione identified the manners and the morals required by socially ambitious men and women for success in a royal court of the italian renaissance 14th 17th c as an etiquette text the courtier was an influential courtesy book in 16th century europe on civility in children 1530 by erasmus of rotterdam instructs boys in the means of becoming a young man how to walk and talk speak and act in the company of adults the practical advice for acquiring adult self awareness includes explanations of the symbolic meanings for adults of a boy s body language when he is fidgeting and yawning scratching and bickering on completing erasmus s curriculum of etiquette the boy has learnt that civility is the point of good manners the adult ability to readily ignore the faults of others but avoid falling short yourself in being civilised 20th century etiquette in society in business in politics and at home 1922 by emily post documents the trivialities of desirable conduct in daily life and provided pragmatic approaches to the practice of good manners the social conduct expected and appropriate for the events of life such as a baptism a wedding and a funeral as didactic texts books of etiquette the conventional rules of personal behaviour in polite society usually feature explanatory titles such as the ladies book of etiquette and manual of politeness a complete hand book for the use of the lady in polite society 1860 by florence hartley amy vanderbilt s complete book of etiquette 1957 miss manners guide to excruciatingly correct behavior 1979 by judith martin and peas queues the minefield of modern manners 2013 by sandi toksvig such books present ranges of civility socially acceptable behaviours for their respective times each author cautions the reader that to be a well mannered person they must practise good manners in their public and private lives the how rude comic book series addresses and discusses adolescent perspectives and questions of etiquette social manners and civility business in commerce the purpose of etiquette is to facilitate the social relations necessary for realising business transactions in particular social interactions among workers and between labour and management business etiquette varies by culture such as the chinese and australian approaches to conflict resolution the chinese business philosophy is based upon guanxi personal connections whereby person to person negotiation resolves difficult matters whereas australian business philosophy relies upon attorneys at law to resolve business conflicts through legal mediation thus adjusting to the etiquette and professional ethics of another culture is an element of culture shock for businesspeople in 2011 etiquette trainers formed the institute of image training and testing international iitti a non profit organisation to train personnel departments in measuring and developing and teaching social skills to employees by way of education in the rules of personal and business etiquette in order to produce business workers who possess standardised manners for successfully conducting business with people from other cultures in the retail branch of commerce the saying the customer is always right summarises the profit orientation of good manners between the buyer and the seller of goods and services there are always two sides to the case of course and it is a credit to good manners that there is scarcely ever any friction in stores and shops of the first class

frown slouching and lowered eye contact suggests disinterest while smiling and an exuberant attitude is a sign of welcome many different gestures are used throughout the world as simple greetings in western cultures the handshake is very common though it has numerous subtle variations in the strength of grip the vigour of the shake the dominant position of one hand over the other and whether or not the left hand is used historically when men normally wore hats out of doors male greetings to people they knew and sometimes those they did not involved touching raising slightly tipping or removing their hat in a variety of gestures this basic gesture remained normal in very many situations from the middle ages until men typically ceased wearing hats in the mid 20th century hat raising began with an element of recognition of superiority where only the socially inferior party might perform it but gradually lost this element king louis xiv of france made a point of at least touching his hat to all women he encountered however the gesture was never used by women for whom their head covering included considerations of modesty when a man was not wearing a hat he might touch his hair to the side of the front of his head to replicate a hat tipping gesture this was typically performed by lower classmen to social superiors such as peasants to the land owner and is known as tugging

precepts extolling civil virtues such as truthfulness self control and kindness towards other people recurrent thematic motifs in the maxims include learning by listening to other people being mindful of the imperfection of human knowledge that avoiding open conflict whenever possible should not be considered weakness and that the pursuit of justice should be foremost yet in human affairs the command of a god ultimately prevails in all matters some of ptahhotep s maxims indicate a person s correct behaviours in the presence of great personages political military religious and instructions on how to choose the right master and how to serve him other maxims teach the correct way to be a leader through openness and kindness that greed is the base of all evil and should be guarded against

in both personal and public life franklin distrusted ostentatious formality and believed manners should serve a purpose rooted in usefulness sincerity and democratic ideals george washington 1732 1799 the first president of the united states and commander of the continental army during the american revolutionary war was heavily influenced in his youth by a set of social maxims titled rules of civility decent behaviour in company and conversation adapted from an earlier french text these 110 rules emphasized humility respect for others restraint and the importance of maintaining decorum in public life though washington did not write the rules himself copying them by hand served as early moral training and significantly shaped his public persona the maxims promoted the idea that civil behavior was a reflection of personal virtue and that etiquette could serve as a tool for cultivating leadership and moral character despite george washington s strong public support for education many of his contemporaries criticized his intellect labeling him as poorly educated and lacking eloquence figures like aaron burr thomas jefferson and john adams described him as unrefined grammatically weak and intellectually limited due to washington s personal sensitivity to the level of his academic exposure these critiques only increased the motivation to copy the 110 rules although there may not be any evidence of george washington verbally passing on the maxims his actions and character served as a physical example of these beliefs politeness in the 18th century during the age of enlightenment the adoption of etiquette was a self conscious process for acquiring the conventions of politeness and the normative behaviours charm manners demeanour which symbolically identified the person as a genteel member of the upper class to identify with the social élite the upwardly mobile middle class and the bourgeoisie adopted the behaviours and the artistic preferences of the upper class to that end socially ambitious people of the middle classes occupied themselves with learning knowing and practising the rules of social etiquette such as the arts of elegant dress and gracious conversation when to show emotion and courtesy with and towards women in the early 18th century anthony ashley cooper 3rd earl of shaftesbury wrote influential essays that defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company and discussed the function and nature of politeness in the social discourse of a commercial society politeness may be defined as dext rous management of our words and actions whereby we make other people have better opinion of us and themselves periodicals such as the spectator a daily publication founded in 1711 by joseph addison and richard steele regularly advised their readers on the etiquette required of a gentleman a man of good and courteous conduct their stated editorial goal was to enliven morality with wit and to temper wit with morality to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries schools and colleges to dwell in clubs and assemblies at tea tables and coffeehouses to which end the editors published articles written by educated authors which provided topics for civil conversation and advice on the requisite manners for carrying a polite conversation and for managing social interactions conceptually allied to etiquette is the notion of civility social interaction characterised by sober and reasoned debate which for socially ambitious men and women also became an important personal quality to possess for social advancement in the event gentlemen s clubs such as harrington s rota club published an in house etiquette that codified the civility expected of the members besides the spectator other periodicals sought to infuse politeness into english coffeehouse conversation the editors of the tatler were explicit that their purpose was the reformation of english manners and morals to those ends etiquette was presented as the virtue of morality and a code of behaviour in the mid 18th century the first modern english usage of etiquette the conventional rules of personal behaviour in polite society was by philip stanhope 4th earl of chesterfield in the book letters to his son on the art of becoming a man of the world and a gentleman 1774 a correspondence of more than 400 letters written from 1737 until the death of his son in 1768 most of the letters were instructive concerning varied subjects that a worldly gentleman should know the letters were first published in 1774 by eugenia stanhope the widow of the diplomat philip stanhope chesterfield s bastard son throughout the correspondence chesterfield endeavoured to decouple the matter of social manners from conventional morality with perceptive observations that pragmatically argue to philip that mastery of etiquette was an important means for social advancement for a man such as he chesterfield s elegant literary style of writing epitomised the emotional restraint characteristic of polite social intercourse in 18th century society i would heartily wish that you may often be seen to smile but never heard to laugh while you live frequent and loud laughter is the characteristic of folly and ill manners it is the manner in which the mob express their silly joy at silly things and they call it being merry in my mind there is nothing so illiberal and so ill bred as audible laughter i am neither of a melancholy nor a cynical disposition and am as willing and as apt to be pleased as anybody but i am sure that since i have had the full use of my reason nobody has ever heard me laugh in the 19th century victorian era 1837 1901 etiquette developed into a complicated system of codified behaviours which governed the range of manners in society from the proper language style and method for writing letters to correctly using cutlery at table and to the minute regulation of social relations and personal interactions between men and women and among the social classes in the 21st century specifically in the early 2020s as digital communication became more readily available and used in everyday life the notion of digital etiquette or netiquette evolved into a flexible socially negotiated code of conduct guiding behavior in online spaces unlike traditional etiquette which often revolved around visible symbols of status and formal conduct digital etiquette today is platform dependent highly situational and subtly influenced by unspoken social norms for instance a video call may press for visible presence camera on and active engagement such as contributing ideas or giving visual cues of attention while sending an email might demand carefully crafted language formal greetings and rapid response times to signal competence and respect an essential aspect of today s netiquette is the management of presence and attention the expectation to be responsive has become a symbol of respect while behaviors such as multitasking during meetings or disabling cameras may be interpreted as disrespect or disengagement manners sociological perspectives in a society manners are described as either good manners or as bad manners to indicate whether a person s behaviour is acceptable to the cultural group as such manners enable ultrasociality and are integral to the functioning of the social norms and conventions that are informally enforced through self regulation the perspectives of sociology indicate that manners are a means for people to display their social status and a means of demarcating observing and maintaining the boundaries of social identity and of social class in the civilizing process 1939 sociologist norbert elias said that manners arose as a product of group living and persist as a way of maintaining social order manners proliferated during the renaissance in response to the development of the absolute state the progression from small group living to large group living characterised by the centralized power of the state the rituals and manners associated with the royal court of england during that period were closely bound to a person s social status manners demonstrate a person s position within a social network and a person s manners are a means of negotiation from that social position from the perspective of public health in the healthy citizen 1995 alana r petersen and deborah lupton said that manners assisted the diminishment of the social boundaries that existed between the public sphere and the private sphere of a person s life and so gave rise to a highly reflective self a self who monitors his or her behavior with due regard for others with whom he or she interacts socially and that the public behavior of individuals came to signify their social standing a means of presenting the self and of evaluating others and thus the control of the outward self was vital sociologist pierre bourdieu applied the concept of habitus to define the societal functions of manners the habitus is the set of mental attitudes personal habits and skills that a person possesses his or her dispositions of character that are neither self determined nor pre determined by the external environment but which are produced and reproduced by social interactions and are inculcated through experience and explicit teaching yet tend to function at the subconscious level manners are likely to be a central part of the dispositions that guide a person s ability to decide upon socially compliant behaviours anthropologic perspective in purity and danger an analysis of concepts of pollution and taboo 2003 the anthropologist mary douglas said that manners social behaviors and group rituals enable the local cosmology to remain ordered and free from those things that may pollute or defile the integrity of the culture ideas of pollution defilement and disgust are attached to the margins of socially acceptable behaviour in order to curtail unacceptable behaviour and so maintain the assumptions by which experience is controlled within the culture evolutionary perspectives in studying the expression of emotion by humans and animals naturalist charles darwin noted the universality of facial expressions of disgust and shame among infants and blind people and concluded that the emotional responses of shame and disgust are innate behaviours public health specialist valerie curtis said that the development of facial responses was concomitant with the development of manners which are behaviours with an evolutionary role in preventing the transmission of diseases thus people who practise personal hygiene and politeness will most benefit from membership in their social group and so stand the best chance of biological survival by way of opportunities for reproduction from the study of the evolutionary bases of prejudice social psychologists catherine cottrell and steven neuberg said that human behavioural responses to otherness might enable the preservation of manners and social norms the feeling of foreignness which people experience in their first social interaction with someone from another culture might partly serve an evolutionary function group living surrounds one with individuals who are able to physically harm fellow group members to spread contagious disease or to free ride on their efforts therefore a commitment to sociality is a risk if threats such as these are left unchecked the costs of sociality will quickly exceed its benefits thus to maximize the returns on group living individual group members should be attuned to others features or behaviors therefore people who possess the social traits common to the cultural group are to be trusted and people without the common social traits are to be distrusted as others and thus treated with suspicion or excluded from the group that pressure of social exclusivity born from the shift towards communal living excluded uncooperative people and persons with poor personal hygiene the threat of social exclusion led people to avoid personal behaviours that might embarrass the group or that might provoke revulsion among the group to demonstrate the transmission of social conformity anthropologists joseph henrich and robert boyd developed a behavioural model in which manners are a means of mitigating social differences curbing undesirable personal behaviours and fostering co operation within the social group natural selection favoured the acquisition of genetically transmitted mechanisms for learning thereby increasing a person s chances for acquiring locally adaptive behaviours humans possess a reliably developing neural encoding that compels them both to punish individuals who violate group norms common beliefs or practices and to punish individuals who do not punish norm violators categories social manners are in three categories i manners of hygiene ii manners of courtesy and iii manners of cultural norm each category accounts for an aspect of the functional role that manners play in a society the categories of manners are based upon the social outcome of behaviour rather than upon the personal motivation of the behaviour as a means of social management the rules of etiquette encompass most aspects of human social interaction thus a rule of etiquette reflects an underlying ethical code and a person s fashion and social status manners of hygiene concern avoiding the transmission of disease and usually are taught by the parent to the child by way of parental discipline positive behavioural enforcement of body fluid continence toilet training and the avoidance of and removal of disease vectors that risk the health of children society expects that by adulthood the manners for personal hygiene have become a second nature behaviour violations of which shall provoke physical and moral disgust hygiene etiquette during the covid 19 pandemic included social distancing and warnings against public spitting manners of courtesy concern self control and good faith behaviour by which a person gives priority to the interests of another person and priority to the interests of a socio cultural group in order to be a trusted member of that group courtesy manners maximize the benefits of group living by regulating the nature of social interactions however the performance of courtesy manners occasionally interferes with the avoidance of communicable disease generally parents teach courtesy manners in the same way they teach hygiene manners but the child also learns manners directly by observing the behaviour of other people in their social interactions and by imagined social interactions through the executive functions of the brain a child usually learns courtesy manners at an older age than when he or she was toilet trained taught hygiene manners because learning the manners of courtesy requires that the child be self aware and conscious of social position which then facilitate understanding that violations accidental or deliberate of social courtesy will provoke peer disapproval within the social group manners of cultural norms concern the social rules by which a person establishes his or her identity and membership in a given socio cultural group in abiding the manners of cultural norm a person demarcates socio cultural identity and establishes social boundaries which then identify whom to trust and whom to distrust as the other cultural norm manners are learnt through the enculturation with and the routinisation of the familiar and through social exposure to the cultural otherness of people identified as foreign to the group transgressions and flouting of the manners of cultural norm usually result in the social alienation of the transgressor the nature of culture norm manners allows a high level of intra group variability but the manners usually are common to the people who identify with the given socio cultural group courtesy books 16th century the book of the courtier 1528 by baldassare castiglione identified the manners and the morals required by socially ambitious men and women for success in a royal court of the italian renaissance 14th 17th c as an etiquette text the courtier was an influential courtesy book in 16th century europe on civility in children 1530 by erasmus of rotterdam instructs boys in the means of becoming a young man how to walk and talk speak and act in the company of adults the practical advice for acquiring adult self awareness includes explanations of the symbolic meanings for adults of a boy s body language when he is fidgeting and yawning scratching and bickering on completing erasmus s curriculum of etiquette the boy has learnt that civility is the point of good manners the adult ability to readily ignore the faults of others but avoid falling short yourself in being civilised 20th century etiquette in society in business in politics and at home

events of life such as a baptism a wedding and a funeral as didactic texts books of etiquette the conventional rules of personal behaviour in polite society usually feature explanatory titles such as the ladies book of etiquette and manual of politeness a complete hand book for the use of the lady in polite society 1860 by florence hartley amy vanderbilt s complete book of etiquette 1957 miss

addresses and discusses adolescent perspectives and questions of etiquette social manners and civility business in commerce the purpose of etiquette is to facilitate the social relations necessary for realising business transactions in particular social interactions among workers and between labour and management business etiquette varies by culture such as the chinese and australian approaches to conflict resolution the chinese business philosophy is based upon guanxi personal connections whereby person to person negotiation resolves difficult matters whereas australian business philosophy relies upon attorneys at law to resolve business conflicts through legal mediation thus adjusting to the etiquette and professional ethics of another culture is an element of culture shock for businesspeople in 2011 etiquette trainers formed the institute of image training and testing international iitti a non profit organisation to train personnel departments in measuring and developing and teaching social skills to employees by way of education in the rules of personal and business etiquette in order to produce business workers who possess standardised manners for successfully conducting business with people from other cultures in the retail branch of commerce the saying the customer is always right summarises the profit orientation of good manners between the buyer and the

you live frequent and loud laughter is the characteristic of folly and ill manners it is the manner in which the mob express their silly joy at silly things and they call it being merry in my mind there is nothing so illiberal and so ill bred as audible laughter i am neither of a melancholy nor a cynical disposition and am as willing and as apt to be pleased as anybody but i am sure that since i have had the full use of my reason nobody has ever heard me laugh in the 19th century victorian era 1837 1901 etiquette developed into a complicated system of codified behaviours which governed the range of manners in society from the proper language style and method for writing letters to correctly using cutlery at table and to the minute regulation of social relations and personal interactions between men and women and among the social classes in the 21st century specifically in the early 2020s as digital communication became more readily available and used in everyday life the notion of digital etiquette or netiquette evolved into a flexible socially negotiated code of conduct guiding behavior in online spaces unlike traditional etiquette which often revolved around visible symbols of status and formal conduct digital etiquette today is platform dependent highly situational and subtly influenced by unspoken social norms for instance a video call may press for visible presence camera on and active engagement such as contributing ideas or giving visual cues of attention while sending an email might demand carefully crafted language formal greetings and rapid response times to signal competence and respect an essential aspect of today s netiquette is the management of presence and attention the expectation to be responsive has become a symbol of respect while behaviors such as multitasking during meetings or disabling cameras may be interpreted as disrespect or disengagement manners sociological perspectives in a society manners are described as either good manners or as bad manners to indicate whether a person s behaviour is acceptable to the cultural group as such manners enable ultrasociality and are integral to the functioning of the social norms and conventions that are informally enforced through self regulation the perspectives of sociology indicate that manners are a means for people to display their social status and a means of demarcating observing and maintaining the boundaries of social identity and of social class in the civilizing process 1939 sociologist norbert elias said that manners arose as a product of group living and persist as a way of maintaining social order manners proliferated during the renaissance in response to the development of the absolute state the progression from small group living to large group living characterised by the centralized power of the state the rituals and manners associated with the royal court of england during that period were closely bound to a person s social status manners demonstrate a person s position within a social network and a person s manners are a means of negotiation from that social position from the perspective of public health in the healthy citizen 1995 alana r petersen and deborah lupton said that manners assisted the diminishment of the social boundaries that existed between the public sphere and the private sphere of a person s life and so gave rise to a highly reflective self a self who monitors his or her behavior with due regard for others with whom he or she interacts socially and that the public behavior of individuals came to signify their social standing a means of presenting the self and of evaluating others and thus the control of the outward self was vital sociologist pierre bourdieu applied the concept of habitus to define the societal functions of manners the habitus is the set of mental attitudes personal habits and skills that a person possesses his or her dispositions of character that are neither self determined nor pre determined by the external environment but which are produced and reproduced by social interactions and are inculcated through experience and explicit teaching yet tend to function at the subconscious level manners are likely to be a central part of the dispositions that guide a person s ability to decide upon socially compliant behaviours anthropologic perspective in purity and danger an analysis of concepts of pollution and taboo 2003 the anthropologist mary douglas said that manners social behaviors and group rituals enable the local cosmology to remain ordered and free from those things that may pollute or defile the integrity of the culture ideas of pollution defilement and disgust are attached to the margins of socially acceptable behaviour in order to curtail unacceptable behaviour and so maintain the assumptions by which experience is controlled within the culture evolutionary perspectives in studying the expression of emotion by humans and animals naturalist charles darwin noted the universality of facial expressions of disgust and shame among infants and blind people and concluded that the emotional responses of shame and disgust are innate behaviours public health specialist valerie curtis said that the development of facial responses was concomitant with the development of manners which are behaviours with an evolutionary role in preventing the transmission of diseases thus people who practise personal hygiene and politeness will most benefit from membership in their social group and so stand the best chance of biological survival by way of opportunities for reproduction from the study of the evolutionary bases of prejudice social psychologists catherine cottrell and steven neuberg said that human behavioural responses to otherness might enable the preservation of manners and social norms the feeling of foreignness which people experience in their first social interaction with someone from another culture might partly serve an evolutionary function group living surrounds one with individuals who are able to physically harm fellow group members to spread contagious disease or to free ride on their efforts therefore a commitment to sociality is a risk if threats such as these are left unchecked the costs of sociality will quickly exceed its benefits thus to maximize the returns on group living individual group members should be attuned to others features or behaviors therefore people who possess the social traits common to the cultural group are to be trusted and people without the common social traits are to be distrusted as others and thus treated with suspicion or excluded from the group that pressure of social exclusivity born from the shift towards communal living excluded uncooperative people and persons with poor personal hygiene the threat of social exclusion led people to avoid personal behaviours that might embarrass the group or that might provoke revulsion among the group to demonstrate the transmission of social conformity anthropologists joseph henrich and robert boyd developed a behavioural model in which manners are a means of mitigating social differences curbing undesirable personal behaviours and fostering co operation within the social group natural selection favoured the acquisition of genetically transmitted mechanisms for learning thereby increasing a person s chances for acquiring locally adaptive behaviours humans possess a reliably developing neural encoding that compels them both to punish individuals who violate group norms common beliefs or practices and to punish individuals who do not punish norm violators categories social manners are in three categories i manners of hygiene ii manners of courtesy and iii manners of cultural norm each category accounts for an aspect of the functional role that manners play in a society the categories of manners are based upon the social outcome of behaviour rather than upon the personal motivation of the behaviour as a means of social management the rules of etiquette encompass most aspects of human social interaction thus a rule of etiquette reflects an underlying ethical code and a person s fashion and social status manners of hygiene concern avoiding the transmission of disease and usually are taught by the parent to the child by way of parental discipline positive behavioural enforcement of body fluid continence toilet training and the avoidance of and removal of disease vectors that risk the health of children society expects that by adulthood the manners for personal hygiene have become a second nature behaviour violations of which shall provoke physical and moral disgust hygiene etiquette during the covid 19 pandemic included social distancing and warnings against public spitting manners of courtesy concern self control and good faith behaviour by which a person gives priority to the interests of another person and priority to the interests of a socio cultural group in order to be a trusted member of that group courtesy manners maximize the benefits of group living by regulating the nature of social interactions however the performance of courtesy manners occasionally interferes with the avoidance of communicable disease generally parents teach courtesy manners in the same way they teach hygiene manners but the child also learns manners directly by observing the behaviour of other people in their social interactions and by imagined social interactions through the executive functions of the brain a child usually learns courtesy manners at an older age than when he or she was toilet trained taught hygiene manners because learning the manners of courtesy requires that the child be self aware and conscious of social position which then facilitate understanding that violations accidental or deliberate of social courtesy will provoke peer disapproval within the social group manners of cultural norms concern the social rules by which a person establishes his or her identity and membership in a given socio cultural group in abiding the manners of cultural norm a person demarcates socio cultural identity and establishes social boundaries which then identify whom to trust and whom to distrust as the other cultural norm manners are learnt through the enculturation with and the routinisation of the familiar and through social exposure to the cultural otherness of people identified as foreign to the group transgressions and flouting of the manners of cultural norm usually result in the social alienation of the transgressor the nature of culture norm manners allows a high level of intra group variability but the manners usually are common to the people who identify with the given socio cultural group courtesy books 16th century the book of the courtier 1528 by baldassare castiglione identified the manners and the morals required by socially ambitious men and women for success in a royal court of the italian renaissance 14th 17th c as an etiquette text the courtier was an influential courtesy book in 16th century europe on civility in children 1530 by erasmus of rotterdam instructs boys in the means of becoming a young man how to walk and talk speak and act in the company of adults the practical advice for acquiring adult self awareness includes explanations of the symbolic meanings for adults of a boy s body language when he is fidgeting and yawning scratching and bickering on completing erasmus s curriculum of etiquette the boy has learnt that civility is the point of good manners the adult ability to readily ignore the faults of others but avoid falling short yourself in being civilised 20th century etiquette in society in business in politics and at home 1922 by emily post documents the trivialities of desirable conduct in daily life and provided pragmatic approaches to the practice of good manners the social conduct expected and appropriate for the events of life such as a baptism a wedding and a funeral as didactic texts books of etiquette the conventional rules of personal behaviour in polite society usually feature explanatory titles such as the ladies book of etiquette and manual of politeness a complete hand book for the use of the lady in polite society 1860 by florence hartley amy vanderbilt s complete book of etiquette 1957 miss

behaviours for their respective times each author cautions the reader that to be a well mannered person they must practise good manners in their public and private lives the how rude comic book series addresses and discusses adolescent perspectives and questions of etiquette social manners and civility business in commerce the purpose of etiquette is to facilitate the social relations necessary for realising business transactions in particular social interactions among workers and between labour and management business etiquette varies by culture such as the chinese and australian approaches to conflict resolution the chinese business philosophy is based upon guanxi personal connections whereby person to person negotiation resolves difficult matters whereas australian business philosophy relies upon attorneys at law to resolve business conflicts through legal mediation thus adjusting to the etiquette and professional ethics of another culture is an element of culture shock for businesspeople in 2011 etiquette trainers formed the institute of image training and testing international iitti a non profit organisation to train personnel departments in measuring and developing and teaching social skills to employees by way of education in the rules of personal and business etiquette in order to produce business workers who possess standardised manners for successfully conducting business with people from other cultures in the retail branch of commerce the saying the customer is always right summarises the profit orientation of good manners between the buyer and the seller of goods and services there are always two sides to the case of course and it is a credit to good manners that there is scarcely ever any friction in stores and shops of the first class

removing their hat in a variety of gestures this basic gesture remained normal in very many situations from the middle ages until men typically ceased wearing hats in the mid 20th century hat raising began with an element of recognition of superiority where only the socially inferior party might perform it but gradually lost this element king louis xiv of france made a point of at least touching his hat to all women he encountered however the gesture was never used by women for whom their head covering included considerations of modesty when a man was not wearing a hat he might touch his hair

\u02c8\u025btik\u025bt k\u026at can be defined as a set of norms of personal behavior in polite society usually occurring in the form of an ethical code of the expected and accepted social behaviors that accord with the conventions and norms observed and practiced by a society a social class or a social group in modern english usage the french word étiquette label and tag dates from the year 1750 and also originates from the french word for ticket possibly symbolizing a person s entry into society through proper behavior there are many important historical figures that have helped to shape the meaning of the term as well as provide varying perspectives history in the third millennium bce the ancient egyptian vizier ptahhotep wrote the maxims of ptahhotep 2375 2350 bce a didactic book of precepts extolling civil virtues such as truthfulness self control and kindness towards other people recurrent thematic motifs in the maxims include learning by listening to other people being mindful of the imperfection of human knowledge that avoiding open conflict whenever possible should not be considered weakness and that the pursuit of justice should be foremost yet in human affairs the command of a god ultimately prevails in all matters some of ptahhotep s maxims indicate a person s correct behaviours in the presence of great personages political military religious and instructions on how to choose the right master and how to serve him other maxims teach the correct way to be a leader through openness and kindness that greed is the base of all evil and should be guarded against and that generosity towards family and friends is praiseworthy confucius 551 479 bce was a chinese intellectual and philosopher whose works emphasized personal and governmental morality correctness of social relationships the pursuit of justice in personal dealings and sincerity in all personal relations baldassare castiglione 1478 1529 ce count of casatico was an italian courtier and diplomat soldier and author of the book of the courtier 1528 an exemplar courtesy book dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier during the italian renaissance louis xiv 1638 1715 king of france used a codified etiquette to tame the french nobility and assert his supremacy as the absolute monarch of france in consequence the ceremonious royal court favourably impressed foreign dignitaries whom the king received at the seat of french government the palace of versailles to the south west of paris benjamin franklin 1706 1790 an american inventor and founding father contributed to the american understanding of etiquette through his emphasis on practical morality and social harmony in his autobiography published in 1791 franklin outlined a personal system of self improvement centered around thirteen virtues including sincerity humility and temperance he viewed etiquette as a means of fostering effective communication avoiding unnecessary conflict and promoting cooperation in both personal and public life franklin distrusted ostentatious formality and believed manners should serve a purpose rooted in usefulness sincerity and democratic ideals george washington 1732 1799 the first president of the united states and commander of the continental army during the american revolutionary war was heavily influenced in his youth by a set of social maxims titled rules of civility decent behaviour in company and conversation adapted from an earlier french text these 110 rules emphasized humility respect for others restraint and the importance of maintaining decorum in public life though washington did not write the rules himself copying them by hand served as early moral training and significantly shaped his public persona the maxims promoted the idea that civil behavior was a reflection of personal virtue and that etiquette could serve as a tool for cultivating leadership and moral character despite george washington s strong public support for education many of his contemporaries criticized his intellect labeling him as poorly educated and lacking eloquence figures like aaron burr thomas jefferson and john adams described him as unrefined grammatically weak and intellectually limited due to washington s personal sensitivity to the level of his academic exposure these critiques only increased the motivation to copy the 110 rules although there may not be any evidence of george washington verbally passing on the maxims his actions and character served as a physical example of these beliefs politeness in the 18th century during the age of enlightenment the adoption of etiquette was a self conscious process for acquiring the conventions of politeness and the normative behaviours charm manners demeanour which symbolically identified the person as a genteel member of the upper class to identify with the social élite the upwardly mobile middle class and the bourgeoisie adopted the behaviours and the artistic preferences of the upper class to that end socially ambitious people of the middle classes occupied themselves with learning knowing and practising the rules of social etiquette such as the arts of elegant dress and gracious conversation when to show emotion and courtesy with and towards women in the early 18th century anthony ashley cooper 3rd earl of shaftesbury wrote influential essays that defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company and discussed the function and nature of politeness in the social discourse of a commercial society politeness may be defined as dext rous management of our words and actions whereby we make other people have better opinion of us and themselves periodicals such as the spectator a daily publication founded in 1711 by joseph addison and richard steele regularly advised their readers on the etiquette required of a gentleman a man of good and courteous conduct their stated editorial goal was to enliven morality with wit and to temper wit with morality to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries schools and colleges to dwell in clubs and assemblies at tea tables and coffeehouses to which end the editors published articles written by educated authors which provided topics for civil conversation and advice on the requisite manners for carrying a polite conversation and for managing social interactions conceptually allied to etiquette is the notion of civility social interaction characterised by sober and reasoned debate which for socially ambitious men and women also became an important personal quality to possess for social advancement in the event gentlemen s clubs such as harrington s rota club published an in house etiquette that codified the civility expected of the members besides the spectator other periodicals sought to infuse politeness into english coffeehouse conversation the editors of the tatler were explicit that their purpose was the reformation of english manners and morals to those ends etiquette was presented as the virtue of morality and a code of behaviour in the mid 18th century the first modern english usage of etiquette the conventional rules of personal behaviour in polite society was by philip stanhope 4th earl of chesterfield in the book letters to his son on the art of becoming a man of the world and a gentleman 1774 a correspondence of more than 400 letters written from 1737 until the death of his son in 1768 most of the letters were instructive concerning varied subjects that a worldly gentleman should know the letters were first published in 1774 by eugenia stanhope the widow of the diplomat philip stanhope chesterfield s bastard son throughout the correspondence chesterfield endeavoured to decouple the matter of social manners from conventional morality with perceptive observations that pragmatically argue to philip that mastery of etiquette was an important means for social advancement for a man such as he chesterfield s elegant literary style of writing epitomised the emotional restraint characteristic of polite social intercourse in 18th century society i would heartily wish that you may often be seen to smile but never heard to laugh while

removing their hat in a variety of gestures this basic gesture remained normal in very many situations from the middle ages until men typically ceased wearing hats in the mid 20th century hat raising

his hat to all women he encountered however the gesture was never used by women for whom their head covering included considerations of modesty when a man was not wearing a hat he might touch his hair

\u02c8\u025btik\u025bt k\u026at can be defined as a set of norms of personal behavior in polite society usually occurring in the form of an ethical code of the expected and accepted social behaviors that accord with the conventions and norms observed and practiced by a society a social class or a social group in modern english usage the french word étiquette label and tag dates from the year 1750 and also originates from the french word for ticket possibly symbolizing a person s entry into society through proper behavior there are many important historical figures that have helped to shape the meaning of the term as well as provide varying perspectives history in the third millennium bce the ancient egyptian vizier ptahhotep wrote the maxims of ptahhotep 2375 2350 bce a didactic book of precepts extolling civil virtues such as truthfulness self control and kindness towards other people recurrent thematic motifs in the maxims include learning by listening to other people being mindful of the imperfection of human knowledge that avoiding open conflict whenever possible should not be considered weakness and that the pursuit of justice should be foremost yet in human affairs the command of a god ultimately prevails in all matters some of ptahhotep s maxims indicate a person s correct behaviours in the presence of great personages political military religious and instructions on how to choose the right master and how to serve him other maxims teach the correct way to be a leader through openness and kindness that greed is the base of all evil and should be guarded against and that generosity towards family and friends is praiseworthy confucius 551 479 bce was a chinese intellectual and philosopher whose works emphasized personal and governmental morality correctness of social relationships the pursuit of justice in personal dealings and sincerity in all personal relations baldassare castiglione 1478 1529 ce count of casatico was an italian courtier and diplomat soldier and author of the book of the courtier 1528 an exemplar courtesy book dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier during the italian renaissance louis xiv 1638 1715 king of france used a codified etiquette to tame the french nobility and assert his supremacy as the absolute monarch of france in consequence the ceremonious royal court favourably impressed foreign dignitaries whom the king received at the seat of french government the palace of versailles to the south west of paris benjamin franklin 1706 1790 an american inventor and founding father contributed to the american understanding of etiquette through his emphasis on practical morality and social harmony in his autobiography published in 1791 franklin outlined a personal system of self improvement centered around thirteen virtues including sincerity humility and temperance he viewed etiquette as a means of fostering effective communication avoiding unnecessary conflict and promoting cooperation in both personal and public life franklin distrusted ostentatious formality and believed manners should serve a purpose rooted in usefulness sincerity and democratic ideals george washington 1732 1799 the first president of the united states and commander of the continental army during the american revolutionary war was heavily influenced in his youth by a set of social maxims titled rules of civility decent behaviour in company and conversation adapted from an earlier french text these 110 rules emphasized humility respect for others restraint and the importance of maintaining decorum in public life though washington did not write the rules himself copying them by hand served as early moral training and significantly shaped his public persona the maxims promoted the idea that civil behavior was a reflection of personal virtue and that etiquette could serve as a tool for cultivating leadership and moral character despite george washington s strong public support for education many of his contemporaries criticized his intellect labeling him as poorly educated and lacking eloquence figures like aaron burr thomas jefferson and john adams described him as unrefined grammatically weak and intellectually limited due to washington s personal sensitivity to the level of his academic exposure these critiques only increased the motivation to copy the 110 rules although there may not be any evidence of george washington verbally passing on the maxims his actions and character served as a physical example of these beliefs politeness in the 18th century during the age of enlightenment the adoption of etiquette was a self conscious process for acquiring the conventions of politeness and the normative behaviours charm manners demeanour which symbolically identified the person as a genteel member of the upper class to identify with the social élite the upwardly mobile middle class and the bourgeoisie adopted the behaviours and the artistic preferences of the upper class to that end socially ambitious people of the middle classes occupied themselves with learning knowing and practising the rules of social etiquette such as the arts of elegant dress and gracious conversation when to show emotion and courtesy with and towards women in the early 18th century anthony ashley cooper 3rd earl of shaftesbury wrote influential essays that defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company and discussed the function and nature of politeness in the social discourse of a commercial society politeness may be defined as dext rous management of our words and actions whereby we make other people have better opinion of us and themselves periodicals such as the spectator a daily publication founded in 1711 by joseph addison and richard steele regularly advised their readers on the etiquette required of a gentleman a man of good and courteous conduct their stated editorial goal was to enliven morality with wit and to temper wit with morality to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries schools and colleges to dwell in clubs and assemblies at tea tables and coffeehouses to which end the editors published articles written by educated authors which provided topics for civil conversation and advice on the requisite manners for carrying a polite conversation and for managing social interactions conceptually allied to etiquette is the notion of civility social interaction characterised by sober and reasoned debate which for socially ambitious men and women also became an important personal quality to possess for social advancement in the event gentlemen s clubs such as harrington s rota club published an in house etiquette that codified the civility expected of the members besides the spectator other periodicals sought to infuse politeness into english coffeehouse conversation the editors of the tatler were explicit that their purpose was the reformation of english manners and morals to those ends etiquette was presented as the virtue of morality and a code of behaviour in the mid 18th century the first modern english usage of etiquette the conventional rules of personal behaviour in polite society was by philip stanhope 4th earl of chesterfield in the book letters to his son on the art of becoming a man of the world and a gentleman 1774 a correspondence of more than 400 letters written from 1737 until the death of his son in 1768 most of the letters were instructive concerning varied subjects that a worldly gentleman should know the letters were first published in 1774 by eugenia stanhope the widow of the diplomat philip stanhope chesterfield s bastard son throughout the correspondence chesterfield endeavoured to decouple the matter of social manners from conventional morality with perceptive observations that pragmatically argue to philip that mastery of etiquette was an important means for social advancement for a man such as he chesterfield s elegant literary style of writing epitomised the emotional restraint characteristic of polite social intercourse in 18th century society i would heartily wish that you may often be seen to smile but never heard to laugh while you live frequent and loud laughter is the characteristic of folly and ill manners it is the manner in which the mob express their silly joy at silly things and they call it being merry in my mind there is nothing so illiberal and so ill bred as audible laughter i am neither of a melancholy nor a cynical disposition and am as willing and as apt to be pleased as anybody but i am sure that since i have had the full use of my reason nobody has ever heard me laugh in the 19th century victorian era 1837 1901 etiquette developed into a complicated system of codified behaviours which governed the range of manners in society from the proper language style and method for writing letters to correctly using cutlery at table and to the minute regulation of social relations and personal interactions between men and women and among the social classes in the 21st century specifically in the early 2020s as digital communication became more readily available and used in everyday life the notion of digital etiquette or netiquette evolved into a flexible socially negotiated code of conduct guiding behavior in online spaces unlike traditional etiquette which often revolved around visible symbols of status and formal conduct digital etiquette today is platform dependent highly situational and subtly influenced by unspoken social norms for instance a video call may press for visible presence camera on and active engagement such as contributing ideas or giving visual cues of attention while sending an email might demand carefully crafted language formal greetings and rapid response times to signal competence and respect an essential aspect of today s netiquette is the management of presence and attention the expectation to be responsive has become a symbol of respect while behaviors such as multitasking during meetings or disabling cameras may be interpreted as disrespect or disengagement manners sociological perspectives in a society manners are described as either good manners or as bad manners to indicate whether a person s behaviour is acceptable to the cultural group as such manners enable ultrasociality and are integral to the functioning of the social norms and conventions that are informally enforced through self regulation the perspectives of sociology indicate that manners are a means for people to display their social status and a means of demarcating observing and maintaining the boundaries of social identity and of social class in the civilizing process 1939 sociologist norbert elias said that manners arose as a product of group living and persist as a way of maintaining social order manners proliferated during the renaissance in response to the development of the absolute state the progression from small group living to large group living characterised by the centralized power of the state the rituals and manners associated with the royal court of england during that period were closely bound to a person s social status manners demonstrate a person s position within a social network and a person s manners are a means of negotiation from that social position from the perspective of public health in the healthy citizen 1995 alana r petersen and deborah lupton said that manners assisted the diminishment of the social boundaries that existed between the public sphere and the private sphere of a person s life and so gave rise to a highly reflective self a self who monitors his or her behavior with due regard for others with whom he or she interacts socially and that the public behavior of individuals came to signify their social standing a means of presenting the self and of evaluating others and thus the control of the outward self was vital sociologist pierre bourdieu applied the concept of habitus to define the societal functions of manners the habitus is the set of mental attitudes personal habits and skills that a person possesses his or her dispositions of character that are neither self determined nor pre determined by the external environment but which are produced and reproduced by social interactions and are inculcated through experience and explicit teaching yet tend to function at the subconscious level manners are likely to be a central part of the dispositions that guide a person s ability to decide upon socially compliant behaviours anthropologic perspective in purity and danger an analysis of concepts of pollution and taboo 2003 the anthropologist mary douglas said that manners social behaviors and group rituals enable the local cosmology to remain ordered and free from those things that may pollute or defile the integrity of the culture ideas of pollution defilement and disgust are attached to the margins of socially acceptable behaviour in order to curtail unacceptable behaviour and so maintain the assumptions by which experience is controlled within the culture evolutionary perspectives in studying the expression of emotion by humans and animals naturalist charles darwin noted the universality of facial expressions of disgust and shame among infants and blind people and concluded that the emotional responses of shame and disgust are innate behaviours public health specialist valerie curtis said that the development of facial responses was concomitant with the development of manners which are behaviours with an evolutionary role in preventing the transmission of diseases thus people who practise personal hygiene and politeness will most benefit from membership in their social group and so stand the best chance of biological survival by way of opportunities for reproduction from the study of the evolutionary bases of prejudice social psychologists catherine cottrell and steven neuberg said that human behavioural responses to otherness might enable the preservation of manners and social norms the feeling of foreignness which people experience in their first social interaction with someone from another culture might partly serve an evolutionary function group living surrounds one with individuals who are able to physically harm fellow group members to spread contagious disease or to free ride on their efforts therefore a commitment to sociality is a risk if threats such as these are left unchecked the costs of sociality will quickly exceed its benefits thus to maximize the returns on group living individual group members should be attuned to others features or behaviors therefore people who possess the social traits common to the cultural group are to be trusted and people without the common social traits are to be distrusted as others and thus treated with suspicion or excluded from the group that pressure of social exclusivity born from the shift towards communal living excluded uncooperative people and persons with poor personal hygiene the threat of social exclusion led people to avoid personal behaviours that might embarrass the group or that might provoke revulsion among the group to demonstrate the transmission of social conformity anthropologists joseph henrich and robert boyd developed a behavioural model in which manners are a means of mitigating social differences curbing undesirable personal behaviours and fostering co operation within the social group natural selection favoured the acquisition of genetically transmitted mechanisms for learning thereby increasing a person s chances for acquiring locally adaptive behaviours humans possess a reliably developing neural encoding that compels them both to punish individuals who violate group norms common beliefs or practices and to punish individuals who do not punish norm violators categories social manners are in three categories i manners of hygiene ii manners of courtesy and iii manners of cultural norm each category accounts for an aspect of the functional role that manners play in a society the categories of manners are based upon the social outcome of behaviour rather than upon the personal motivation of the behaviour as a means of social management the rules of etiquette encompass most aspects of human social interaction thus a rule of etiquette reflects an underlying ethical code and a person s fashion and social status manners of hygiene concern avoiding the transmission of disease and usually are taught by the parent to the child by way of parental discipline positive behavioural enforcement of body fluid continence toilet training and the avoidance of and removal of disease vectors that risk the health of children society expects that by adulthood the

the interests of a socio cultural group in order to be a trusted member of that group courtesy manners maximize the benefits of group living by regulating the nature of social interactions however the performance of courtesy manners occasionally interferes with the avoidance of communicable disease generally parents teach courtesy manners in the same way they teach hygiene manners but the child also learns manners directly by observing the behaviour of other people in their social interactions and by imagined social interactions through the executive functions of the brain a child usually

his hat to all women he encountered however the gesture was never used by women for whom their head covering included considerations of modesty when a man was not wearing a hat he might touch his hair

\u02c8\u025btik\u025bt k\u026at can be defined as a set of norms of personal behavior in polite society usually occurring in the form of an ethical code of the expected and accepted social behaviors that accord with the conventions and norms observed and practiced by a society a social class or a social group in modern english usage the french word étiquette label and tag dates from the year 1750 and also originates from the french word for ticket possibly symbolizing a person s entry into society through proper behavior there are many important historical figures that have helped to shape the meaning of the term as well as provide varying perspectives history in the third millennium bce the ancient egyptian vizier ptahhotep wrote the maxims of ptahhotep 2375 2350 bce a didactic book of precepts extolling civil virtues such as truthfulness self control and kindness towards other people recurrent thematic motifs in the maxims include learning by listening to other people being mindful of the imperfection of human knowledge that avoiding open conflict whenever possible should not be considered weakness and that the pursuit of justice should be foremost yet in human affairs the command of a god ultimately prevails in all matters some of ptahhotep s maxims indicate a person s correct behaviours in the presence of great personages political military religious and instructions on how to choose the right master and how to serve him other maxims teach the correct way to be a leader through openness and kindness that greed is the base of all evil and should be guarded against and that generosity towards family and friends is praiseworthy confucius 551 479 bce was a chinese intellectual and philosopher whose works emphasized personal and governmental morality correctness of social relationships the pursuit of justice in personal dealings and sincerity in all personal relations baldassare castiglione 1478 1529 ce count of casatico was an italian courtier and diplomat soldier and author of the book of the courtier 1528 an exemplar courtesy book dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier during the italian renaissance louis xiv 1638 1715 king of france used a codified etiquette to tame the french nobility and assert his supremacy as the absolute monarch of france in consequence the ceremonious royal court favourably impressed foreign dignitaries whom the king received at the seat of french government the palace of versailles to the south west of paris benjamin franklin 1706 1790 an american inventor and founding father contributed to the american understanding of etiquette through his emphasis on practical morality and social harmony in his autobiography published in 1791 franklin outlined a personal system of self improvement centered around thirteen virtues including sincerity humility and temperance he viewed etiquette as a means of fostering effective communication avoiding unnecessary conflict and promoting cooperation in both personal and public life franklin distrusted ostentatious formality and believed manners should serve a purpose rooted in usefulness sincerity and democratic ideals george washington 1732 1799 the first president of the united states and commander of the continental army during the american revolutionary war was heavily influenced in his youth by a set of social maxims titled rules of civility decent behaviour in company and conversation adapted from an earlier french text these 110 rules emphasized humility respect for others restraint and the importance of maintaining decorum in public life though washington did not write the rules himself copying them by hand served as early moral training and significantly shaped his public persona the maxims promoted the idea that civil behavior was a reflection of personal virtue and that etiquette could serve as a tool for cultivating leadership and moral character despite george washington s strong public support for education many of his contemporaries criticized his intellect labeling him as poorly educated and lacking eloquence figures like aaron burr thomas jefferson and john adams described him as unrefined grammatically weak and intellectually limited due to washington s personal sensitivity to the level of his academic exposure these critiques only increased the motivation to copy the 110 rules although there may not be any evidence of george washington verbally passing on the maxims his actions and character served as a physical example of these beliefs politeness in the 18th century during the age of enlightenment the adoption of etiquette was a self conscious process for acquiring the conventions of politeness and the normative behaviours charm manners demeanour which symbolically identified the person as a genteel member of the upper class to identify with the social élite the upwardly mobile middle class and the bourgeoisie adopted the behaviours and the artistic preferences of the upper class to that end socially ambitious people of the middle classes occupied themselves with learning knowing and practising the rules of social etiquette such as the arts of elegant dress and gracious conversation when to show emotion and courtesy with and towards women in the early 18th century anthony ashley cooper 3rd earl of shaftesbury wrote influential essays that defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company and discussed the function and nature of politeness in the social discourse of a commercial society politeness may be defined as dext rous management of our words and actions whereby we make other people have better opinion of us and themselves periodicals such as the spectator a daily publication founded in 1711 by joseph addison and richard steele regularly advised their readers on the etiquette required of a gentleman a man of good and courteous conduct their stated editorial goal was to enliven morality with wit and to temper wit with morality to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries schools and colleges to dwell in clubs and assemblies at tea tables and coffeehouses to which end the editors published articles written by educated authors which provided topics for civil conversation and advice on the requisite manners for carrying a polite conversation and for managing social interactions conceptually allied to etiquette is the notion of civility social interaction characterised by sober and reasoned debate which for socially ambitious men and women also became an important personal quality to possess for social advancement in the event gentlemen s clubs such as harrington s rota club published an in house etiquette that codified the civility expected of the members besides the spectator other periodicals sought to infuse politeness into english coffeehouse conversation the editors of the tatler were explicit that their purpose was the reformation of english manners and morals to those ends etiquette was presented as the virtue of morality and a code of behaviour in the mid 18th century the first modern english usage of etiquette the conventional rules of personal behaviour in polite society was by philip stanhope 4th earl of chesterfield in the book letters to his son on the art of becoming a man of the world and a gentleman 1774 a correspondence of more than 400 letters written from 1737 until the death of his son in 1768 most of the letters were instructive concerning varied subjects that a worldly gentleman should know the letters were first published in 1774 by eugenia stanhope the widow of the diplomat philip stanhope chesterfield s bastard son throughout the correspondence chesterfield endeavoured to decouple the matter of social manners from conventional morality with perceptive observations that pragmatically argue to philip that mastery of etiquette was an important means for social advancement for a man such as he chesterfield s elegant literary style of writing epitomised the emotional restraint characteristic of polite social intercourse in 18th century society i would heartily wish that you may often be seen to smile but never heard to laugh while you live frequent and loud laughter is the characteristic of folly and ill manners it is the manner in which the mob express their silly joy at silly things and they call it being merry in my mind there is nothing so illiberal and so ill bred as audible laughter i am neither of a melancholy nor a cynical disposition and am as willing and as apt to be pleased as anybody but i am sure that since i have had the full use of my reason nobody has ever heard me laugh in the 19th century victorian era 1837 1901 etiquette developed into a complicated system of codified behaviours which governed the range of manners in society from the proper language style and method for writing letters to correctly using cutlery at table and to the minute regulation of social relations and personal interactions between men and women and among the social classes in the 21st century specifically in the early 2020s as digital communication became more readily available and used in everyday life the notion of digital etiquette or netiquette evolved into a flexible socially negotiated code of conduct guiding behavior in online spaces unlike traditional etiquette which often revolved around visible symbols of status and formal conduct digital etiquette today is platform dependent highly situational and subtly influenced by unspoken social norms for instance a video call may press for visible presence camera on and active engagement such as contributing ideas or giving visual cues of attention while sending an email might demand carefully crafted language formal greetings and rapid response times to signal competence and respect an essential aspect of today s netiquette is the management of presence and attention the expectation to be responsive has become a symbol of respect while behaviors such as multitasking during meetings or disabling cameras may be interpreted as disrespect or disengagement manners sociological perspectives in a society manners are described as either good manners or as bad manners to indicate whether a person s behaviour is acceptable to the cultural group as such manners enable ultrasociality and are integral to the functioning of the social norms and conventions that are informally enforced through self regulation the perspectives of sociology indicate that manners are a means for people to display their social status and a means of demarcating observing and maintaining the boundaries of social identity and of social class in the civilizing process 1939 sociologist norbert elias said that manners arose as a product of group living and persist as a way of maintaining social order manners proliferated during the renaissance in response to the development of the absolute state the progression from small group living to large group living characterised by the centralized power of the state the rituals and manners associated with the royal court of england during that period were closely bound to a person s social status manners demonstrate a person s position within a social network and a person s manners are a means of negotiation from that social position from the perspective of public health in the healthy citizen 1995 alana r petersen and deborah lupton said that manners assisted the diminishment of the social boundaries that existed between the public sphere and the private sphere of a person s life and so gave rise to a highly reflective self a self who monitors his or her behavior with due regard for others with whom he or she interacts socially and that the public behavior of individuals came to signify their social standing a means of presenting the self and of evaluating others and thus the control of the outward self was vital sociologist pierre bourdieu applied the concept of habitus to define the societal functions of manners the habitus is the set of mental attitudes personal habits and skills that a person possesses his or her dispositions of character that are neither self determined nor pre determined by the external environment but which are produced and reproduced by social interactions and are inculcated through experience and explicit teaching yet tend to function at the subconscious level manners are likely to be a central part of the dispositions that guide a person s ability to decide upon socially compliant behaviours anthropologic perspective in purity and danger an analysis of concepts of pollution and taboo 2003 the anthropologist mary douglas said that manners social behaviors and group rituals enable the local cosmology to remain ordered and free from those things that may pollute or defile the integrity of the culture ideas of pollution defilement and disgust are attached to the margins of socially acceptable behaviour in order to curtail unacceptable behaviour and so maintain the assumptions by which experience is controlled within the culture evolutionary perspectives in studying the expression of emotion by humans and animals naturalist charles darwin noted the universality of facial expressions of disgust and shame among infants and blind people and concluded that the emotional responses of shame and disgust are innate behaviours public health specialist valerie curtis said that the development of facial responses was concomitant with the development of manners which are behaviours with an evolutionary role in preventing the transmission of diseases thus people who practise personal hygiene and politeness will most benefit from membership in their social group and so stand the best chance of biological survival by way of opportunities for reproduction from the study of the evolutionary bases of prejudice social psychologists catherine cottrell and steven neuberg said that human behavioural responses to otherness might enable the preservation of manners and social norms the feeling of foreignness which people experience in their first social interaction with someone from another culture might partly serve an evolutionary function group living surrounds one with individuals who are able to physically harm fellow group members to spread contagious disease or to free ride on their efforts therefore a commitment to sociality is a risk if threats such as these are left unchecked the costs of sociality will quickly exceed its benefits thus to maximize the returns on group living individual group members should be attuned to others features or behaviors therefore people who possess the social traits common to the cultural group are to be trusted and people without the common social traits are to be distrusted as others and thus treated with suspicion or excluded from the group that pressure of social exclusivity born from the shift towards communal living excluded uncooperative people and persons with poor personal hygiene the threat of social exclusion led people to avoid personal behaviours that might embarrass the group or that might provoke revulsion among the group to demonstrate the transmission of social conformity anthropologists joseph henrich and robert boyd developed a behavioural model in which manners are a means of mitigating social differences curbing undesirable personal behaviours and fostering co operation within the social group natural selection favoured the acquisition of genetically transmitted mechanisms for learning thereby increasing a person s chances for acquiring locally adaptive behaviours humans possess a reliably developing neural encoding that compels them both to punish individuals who violate group norms common beliefs or practices and to punish individuals who do not punish norm violators categories social manners are in three categories i manners of hygiene ii manners of courtesy and iii manners of cultural norm each category accounts for an aspect of the functional role that manners play in a society the categories of manners are based upon the social outcome of behaviour rather than upon the personal motivation of the behaviour as a means of social management the rules of etiquette encompass most aspects of human social interaction thus a rule of etiquette reflects an underlying ethical code and a person s fashion and social status manners of hygiene concern avoiding the transmission of disease and usually are taught by the parent to the child by way of parental discipline positive behavioural enforcement of body fluid continence toilet training and the avoidance of and removal of disease vectors that risk the health of children society expects that by adulthood the manners for personal hygiene have become a second nature behaviour violations of which shall provoke physical and moral disgust hygiene etiquette during the covid 19 pandemic included social distancing and warnings against public spitting manners of courtesy concern self control and good faith behaviour by which a person gives priority to the interests of another person and priority to the interests of a socio cultural group in order to be a trusted member of that group courtesy manners maximize the benefits of group living by regulating the nature of social interactions however the performance of courtesy manners occasionally interferes with the avoidance of communicable disease generally parents teach courtesy manners in the same way they teach hygiene manners but the child also learns manners directly by observing the behaviour of other people in their social interactions and by imagined social interactions through the executive functions of the brain a child usually learns courtesy manners at an older age than when he or she was toilet trained taught hygiene manners because learning the manners of courtesy requires that the child be self aware and conscious of social position which then facilitate understanding that violations accidental or deliberate of social courtesy will provoke peer disapproval within the social group manners of cultural norms concern the social rules by which a person establishes his or her identity and membership in a given socio cultural group in abiding the manners of cultural norm a person demarcates socio cultural identity and establishes social boundaries which then identify whom to trust and whom to distrust as the other cultural norm manners are learnt through the enculturation with and the routinisation of the familiar and through social exposure to the cultural otherness of people identified as foreign to the group transgressions and flouting of the manners of cultural norm usually result in the social alienation of the transgressor the nature of culture norm manners allows a high level of intra group variability but the manners usually are common to the people who identify with the given socio cultural group courtesy books 16th century the book of the courtier 1528 by baldassare castiglione identified the manners and the morals required by socially ambitious men and women for success in a royal court of the italian renaissance 14th 17th c as an etiquette text the courtier was an influential courtesy book in 16th century europe on civility in children 1530 by erasmus of rotterdam instructs boys in the means of becoming a young man how to walk and talk speak and act in the company of adults the practical advice for acquiring adult self awareness includes explanations of the symbolic meanings for adults of a boy s body language when he is fidgeting and yawning scratching and bickering on completing erasmus s curriculum of etiquette the boy has learnt that civility is the point of good manners the adult ability to readily ignore the faults of others but avoid falling short yourself in being civilised 20th century etiquette in society in business in politics and at home 1922 by emily post documents the trivialities of desirable conduct in daily life and provided pragmatic approaches to the practice of good manners the social conduct expected and appropriate for the events of life such as a baptism a wedding and a funeral as didactic texts books of etiquette the conventional rules of personal behaviour in polite society usually feature explanatory titles such as the ladies book of etiquette and manual of politeness a complete hand book for the use of the lady in polite society 1860 by florence hartley amy vanderbilt s complete book of etiquette 1957 miss manners guide to excruciatingly correct behavior 1979 by judith martin and peas queues the minefield of modern manners 2013 by sandi toksvig such books present ranges of civility socially acceptable behaviours for their respective times each author cautions the reader that to be a well mannered person they must practise good manners in their public and private lives the how rude comic book series addresses and discusses adolescent perspectives and questions of etiquette social manners and civility business in commerce the purpose of etiquette is to facilitate the social relations necessary for realising business transactions in particular social interactions among workers and between labour and management business etiquette varies by culture such as the chinese and australian approaches to conflict resolution the chinese business philosophy is based upon guanxi personal connections whereby person to person negotiation resolves difficult matters whereas australian business philosophy relies upon attorneys at law to resolve business conflicts through legal mediation thus adjusting to the etiquette and professional ethics of another culture is an element of culture shock for businesspeople in 2011 etiquette trainers formed the institute of image training and testing international iitti a non profit organisation to train personnel departments in measuring and developing and teaching social skills to employees by way of education in the rules of personal and business etiquette in order to produce business workers who possess standardised manners for successfully conducting business with people from other cultures in the retail branch of commerce the saying the customer is always right summarises the profit orientation of good manners between the buyer and the seller of goods and services there are always two sides to the case of course and it is a credit to good manners that there is scarcely ever any friction in stores and shops of the first class salesmen and women are usually persons who are both patient and polite and their customers are most often ladies in fact as well as by courtesy between those before and those behind the counters there has sprung up in many instances a relationship of mutual goodwill and friendliness it is in fact only the woman who is afraid that someone may encroach upon her exceedingly insecure dignity who shows neither courtesy nor consideration to any except those whom she considers it to her advantage to please see also references further reading --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters --
