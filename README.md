# Comprehensive Text Generation Project

## Overview

This project implements an advanced neural network system for text generation. It supports various architectures, including Vanilla RNN, GRU, LSTM, and Transformer models, with optional multi-task learning. It also features:

- Adaptive Training – Early stopping, learning rate scheduling, reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning.
- Data Augmentation – Back-translation, synonym replacement, and paraphrasing.
- Ensemble Learning – Combining RNN, GRU, LSTM, and Transformers with a neural voting system.
- Inference Techniques – Beam search, greedy sampling, and PID-controlled inference.
- Robust Logging & Monitoring – TensorBoard visualization, extensive model checkpointing, and active learning.

# neural_network — quick start

This repository contains a small text-generation research project (LSTM/GRU/MLP/Transformer candidates), a training loop, and a simple inference pipeline.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (3.11 recommended)
- A working Python environment (venv or conda)
- Optional: GPU + CUDA for faster training

Install dependencies

Windows PowerShell (recommended):

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or with conda (example):

```powershell
conda create -n nn-env python=3.11 -y; conda activate nn-env
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Quick runs

- Non-interactive inference (CI-friendly):

```powershell
python main.py --mode infer --skip-chat
```

- Train for a few epochs:

```powershell
python main.py --mode train --epochs 3
```

Helpers
- `run.ps1` — convenience PowerShell script that creates/uses a `.venv` and runs the project (see file header for usage).
- `scripts/smoke_test.ps1` — the CI smoke test used by GitHub Actions.

Tests & CI
- Unit tests live under `tests/`. To run locally:

```powershell
python -m pip install pytest
python -m pytest -q
```

- GitHub Actions runs a smoke test and pytest on push/PR to `main` (Windows + Ubuntu matrix).

Notes
- Optional dependencies (e.g., `wikipediaapi`, `googletrans`, `deep-translator`) are imported lazily; missing optional packages will not prevent startup.
- If you plan to train larger models, run on a machine with a GPU and install PyTorch with CUDA support per https://pytorch.org

## Ensemble & Tracing Features

### Ensemble Modes

The project supports multiple ensemble generation strategies (set in `config.CONFIG` or via CLI `--ensemble-mode`):

| Mode             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `simple`         | Independent generation per selected models; outputs are combined by equal-weight string fusion (basic). |
| `learned`        | Log-prob fusion of LSTM + Transformer with a fixed weight (`ENSEMBLE_LSTM_WEIGHT`). Temperature optionally normalized (`ENSEMBLE_TEMP_ALIGN`). |
| `learned_dynamic`| Same as `learned`, but weights are derived from inverse validation loss stored in `ensemble_stats.json` (auto-updated after training rounds). |

CLI override example:

```powershell
python main.py --mode infer --ensemble-mode learned_dynamic --prompt "The future of AI"
```

If dynamic stats are missing, the generator falls back to the static weight and logs a warning.

### Tracing & Diversity Metrics

Per-step generation tracing (token probabilities, entropy, chosen token, temperature) is enabled by default (`GENERATION_TRACE=True`). You can control it via:

```powershell
python main.py --mode infer --prompt "Hello" --no-trace   # disable tracing
python main.py --mode infer --prompt "Hello" --trace      # force enable tracing
python main.py --mode infer --prompt "Hello" --trace-file custom_trace.json
```

The trace file (JSON) contains:
- `steps`: array of per-token records (top-k logits/probs, entropy, weights if ensemble)
- `summary`: aggregate metrics (distinct-1/2/3, repetition ratio, avg entropy, temperature drift, ensemble weights when applicable)

### Inference Logging

A structured JSONL log is appended to `logs/inference.log` for each inference run with fields:

```json
{
	"ts": 1730000000.123,
	"prompt_hash": "abcd1234ef567890",
	"prompt_preview": "The future of AI...",
	"tokens_generated": 118,
	"ensemble_mode": "learned_dynamic",
	"trace_file": "generation_trace.json",
	"metrics": { "distinct_1": 0.78, ... }
}
```

Use this for offline analysis or regression tracking. The prompt hash is a SHA-256 truncated digest; full prompts are intentionally not stored beyond a short preview for privacy.

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Ensemble not activating | Forced single model via `--model` or missing required pair (lstm+transformer) | Remove `--model` and ensure both checkpoints exist |
| Missing dynamic weights | `ensemble_stats.json` absent or outdated | Run training (at least one validation pass) to regenerate stats |
| Trace file empty | Early exception or disabled via `--no-trace` | Re-run with `--trace` and check console warnings |

## OOV (Out-of-Vocabulary) Behavior

Unknown tokens in a prompt are mapped to `<UNK>` and do not crash generation. You can add high-frequency OOV tokens by rebuilding the vocabulary or lowering `MIN_FREQUENCY` in `config/config.py`.

## Development Tips

- Use `--max-train-batches N` for a fast smoke test of the training loop.
- `--grad-accum-steps` helps simulate larger batch sizes on limited memory.
- To profile generation speed, disable tracing and diversity metrics (`--no-trace` and set `DIVERSITY_METRICS=False`).
