# Comprehensive Text Generation Project

## Overview

This project implements an advanced neural network system for text generation. It supports various architectures, including Vanilla RNN, GRU, LSTM, and Transformer models, with optional multi-task learning. It also features:

- Adaptive Training – Early stopping, learning rate scheduling, reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning.
- Data Augmentation – Back-translation, synonym replacement, and paraphrasing.
- Ensemble Learning – Combining RNN, GRU, LSTM, and Transformers with a neural voting system.
- Inference Techniques – Beam search, greedy sampling, and PID-controlled inference.
- Robust Logging & Monitoring – TensorBoard visualization, extensive model checkpointing, and active learning.
