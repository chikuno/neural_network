# Comprehensive Text Generation Project

## Overview

This project implements an advanced neural network system for text generation. It supports various architectures, including Vanilla RNN, GRU, LSTM, and Transformer models, with optional multi-task learning. It also features:

- Adaptive Training – Early stopping, learning rate scheduling, reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning.
- Data Augmentation – Back-translation, synonym replacement, and paraphrasing.
- Ensemble Learning – Combining RNN, GRU, LSTM, and Transformers with a neural voting system.
- Inference Techniques – Beam search, greedy sampling, and PID-controlled inference.
- Robust Logging & Monitoring – TensorBoard visualization, extensive model checkpointing, and active learning.

# neural_network — quick start

This repository contains a small text-generation research project (LSTM/GRU/MLP/Transformer candidates), a training loop, and a simple inference pipeline.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (3.11 recommended)
- A working Python environment (venv or conda)
- Optional: GPU + CUDA for faster training

Install dependencies

Windows PowerShell (recommended):

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or with conda (example):

```powershell
conda create -n nn-env python=3.11 -y; conda activate nn-env
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Quick runs

- Non-interactive inference (CI-friendly):

```powershell
python main.py --mode infer --skip-chat
```

- Train for a few epochs:

```powershell
python main.py --mode train --epochs 3
```

Helpers
- `run.ps1` — convenience PowerShell script that creates/uses a `.venv` and runs the project (see file header for usage).
- `scripts/smoke_test.ps1` — the CI smoke test used by GitHub Actions.

Tests & CI
- Unit tests live under `tests/`. To run locally:

```powershell
python -m pip install pytest
python -m pytest -q
```

- GitHub Actions runs a smoke test and pytest on push/PR to `main` (Windows + Ubuntu matrix).

Notes
- Optional dependencies (e.g., `wikipediaapi`, `googletrans`, `deep-translator`) are imported lazily; missing optional packages will not prevent startup.
- If you plan to train larger models, run on a machine with a GPU and install PyTorch with CUDA support per https://pytorch.org
